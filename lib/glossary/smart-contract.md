They could be used in the following scenarios:

Scenario #1:

Alice and Bob and Claire run a consulting firm together. All funds paid to the firm are paid to a single bitcoin address. Alice, Bob and Claire would like make it so that all three of them are signatories for that address and that funds can only be transferred from that address if at least two signatories authorize the transfer. Additionally, if funds have been sitting in the address for over 90 days, they'd like for their attorney to be able to act as a signatory.

Scenario #2:

A consortium of 20 brokerages that trade stock X would like to create a history of prices for that stock.
