smart contract, self-executing contract

## Content

A smart contract is an automatically enforced, programmatically executed contract. In the context of cryptocurrency, a smart contract is executed by a peer-to-peer network of computers powering a given coin.

They could be used to enforce the arrangements outlined in the following scenarios:

Scenario #1:

Alice and Bob and Claire run a consulting firm together. All funds paid to the firm are paid to a single bitcoin address. Alice, Bob and Claire would like make it so that all three of them are signatories for that address and that funds can only be transferred from that address if at least two signatories authorize the transfer. Additionally, if funds have been sitting in the address for over 90 days, they'd like for their attorney to be able to act as a signatory.

Scenario #2:

A consortium of 21 brokerages place bets with each other on behalf of themselves and their clients on the price of X. They would like to create an official daily price for X. Every day at 5pm they each agree to a) submit a their estimate of the current price of X and b) pay $1000 into a shared account. The firm that provides the median price over the entire set of 21 prices receives a pay out of $5000 from the shared account, while the 8 other firms closest to that median recieve $2000 a piece, leaving nothing left for remaining firms. 

Scenario #3:

Two people want to place a bet on the price of X. They each pay $100 into an account. One month in the future, whoever won the bet receives all of the money in the account.

Such smart contracts would live on a single chain (i.e. on the network powering a single cryptocurrency) and would only be capable transferring on-chain assets (i.e. cryptocurrency) to the undersigned parties.
