A smart contract is an automatically enforced, programmatically executed agreement. In the context of cryptocurrency, a smart contract is executed by the peer-to-peer network of computers powering a given coin.

A smart contract can be used to stipulate a financial agreement between two or more parties. It can also be used to specify the interface, functionality, and working conditions of a dapp. 

The scope of what can be done with a smart contract is dictated by the platform (i.e. cryptocurrency) on top of which it runs. Some cryptocurrencies that support smart contracts support only basic smart contracts (e.g. Bitcoin), while others (e.g. Ethereum) can support more sophisticated smart contracts (also known as dapps).

A basic smart contract could be used to enforce the arrangement outlined in the following scenario:

Alice, Bob and Claire run a consulting firm together. All funds paid to the firm are paid to a single address. Alice, Bob and Claire would like make it so that all three of them are signatories for that address and that funds can only be transferred from that address if at least two signatories authorize the transfer. Additionally, if funds have been sitting in the address for over 90 days, they'd like for their attorney to be able to act as a signatory.

A more sophisticated smart contract (i.e. a dapp) could be used to do the following:

Diane would like to create a virtual world in which people are capable of buying plots of land. She creates a smart contract that describes how this works. The smart contract stipulates that anybody who pays the equivalent of 1 USD into the contract will be publicly assigned 1 random plot of land for the first 1000 plots. After that, they will be sent an error message saying no more plots are available. Additionally, the contract stipulates that a sale prices can be publicly listed alongside a plot of land. If a sale price is listed for a plot of land, anybody can send a message to the contract, along with funds equal to the sale price, and the contract will transfer the land to the buyer and the funds to owner of that plot.
