Delegated proof-of-stake (abbreviated DPoS) works similarly to proof-of-stake in that it assigns power within a network to nodes based on the amount of coin they hold. Additionally, a DPoS system allows nodes to delegate their power to other nodes that can act on their behalf. 

One motivation for DPoS is that, unlike PoS, it affords representation to offline nodes.
