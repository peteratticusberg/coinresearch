Generally speaking, a dapp platform is a cryptocurrency that is capable of running dapps. 

More specifically, a dapp platform is a P2P network of computers capable of running dapps, along with a consensus protocol that specifies how dapps are to be run. Because it is costly to power such a P2P network, dapps compensate the network whenever they are run with a value token native to the dapp platform. 

For example, Ethereum is a dapp platform and ETH is the unit of value that dapps use to pay the P2P network powering the platform. The fee that dapps pay to the network that runs them is called "gas". This fee is typically paid by the end user of the dapp, not the creators of the dapp themselves.
