## Content

Proof-of-stake (abbreviated PoS) is a system wherein the nodes in a P2P network are assigned power commensurate with the amount of coin they hold. 

With proof-of-stake a malicious actor would need own a large amount of a coin (typically an amount approaching 51%) to meaningfully interfere with that coin's network. This creates financial disincentives for any potential attacker that scale with the value of a coin. This is because, generally speaking, an attack on the network would also consitute an attack on the attacker's investment.
