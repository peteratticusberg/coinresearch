Generally speaking, a hard fork occurs when a specific type of update to a cryptocurrency is adopted by some -- but not all -- of the computers (i.e. the P2P network) powering it. Such hard forks result in one cryptocurrency becoming two separate cryptocurrencies. The split between Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is perhaps the most famous example of a hard fork. Generally speaking, anyone who owns coins in a currency before it hard forks owns coins in each version of the currency created by the fork.

More specifically, a hard fork occurs when a newly mined block is recognized as valid by some mining nodes, and invalid by others. When this happens, it's typically because one group of miners has chosen to update the consensus protocol they use to validate blocks while another group has chosen not to adopt that update. Each group of miners continues adding blocks to the branch of the blockchain that they recognize as legitimate. Both groups of miners recognize blocks that had been mined prior to the fork as valid.
