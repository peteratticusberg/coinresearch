asymmetric cyptography, public key cryptography

## Content

Asymmetric cryptography, or Public-key cryptography, uses a public and private key pair to encrypt data. Data encrypted using a public key can only be decrypted using its corresponding private key [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). 

Additionally, arbitrary digitized data -- such as a bitcoin transaction -- can be "signed" using a private key [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography). Digital signatures are used to indicate the signatory's (i.e. the private key owner's) approval and/or awareness of a piece of data. 

Private Keys cannot be reverse engineered from Public Keys with contemporary computers [(src)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/2847/how-long-would-it-take-a-large-computer-to-crack-a-private-key). They can be stolen if not stored securely.

Virtually all cryptocurrencies use this form of cryptography to determine ownership of funds.
