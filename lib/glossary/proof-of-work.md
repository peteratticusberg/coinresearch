## Content

Proof-of-work (abreviated as PoW) is a system in which computers expend computational effort in exchange for permissions within a network. 

Proof-of-work is used by many cryptocurrencies to gate active participation in the P2P network by which they are powered. This makes it impossible for malicious actors to interfere with a given cryptocurrency without expending large amounts of computing resources. 

By way of example, for a malicious actor to acquire enough computing power to take control of the PoW-based bitcoin network she would need to spend roughly $3B USD on hardware. Sustaining that control would take roughly $285,000 worth of electricity per hour. These numbers are from February 2018 [(src)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/70339/51219).
