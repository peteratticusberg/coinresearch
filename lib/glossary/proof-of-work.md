Proof-of-work (abreviated as PoW) is a mechanism whereby computers are required to expend computational effort in exchange for permissions within a network. 

Proof-of-work is used by many cryptocurrencies to gate active participation in the P2P network by which they are powered. This makes it difficult for malicious actors to interfere with a given cryptocurrency without expending large amounts of computing resources. 

By way of example, a malicious actor looking to control a majority of the computational resources in the P2P network behind bitcoin would need to spend roughly $3B USD on hardware plus $285,000/hour on electricity to sustain that control (as of February 2018) [(src)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/70339/51219).
