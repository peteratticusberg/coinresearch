A peer-to-peer network (also known as a P2P network), is a network of computers in which a node's (i.e. a computer's) level of authority, power, or control in the network is equivalent only to that which has been placed in it by its peers (i.e. the other nodes). 

The vast majority of cryptocurrencies are powered by public P2P networks of computers running open source consensus protocols. These networks validate, settle, and record transactions for their associated currencencies.

Virtually all modern-day networked applications (e.g. facebook, amazon.com, gmail, ebay, paypal, etc.) are not powered by public P2P networks, but rather by a central cluster of servers controlled by a private company.
