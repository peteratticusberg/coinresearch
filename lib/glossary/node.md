In the context of cryptocurrency, the term node is often used to refer to a participant in a peer-to-peer network. A participant is a running instance of a software program capable of communicating with other participants over the internet. 

Phones, desktops, and networked clusters of machines are all capable of operating as a single participant within a P2P network. It also possible for a single machine to behave as multiple participants by running multiple instances of the P2P client software.

Not all nodes in a P2P network play the same role. In bitcoin for example, some nodes -- referred as miners -- expend very significant computational energy to validate and settle transactions. Other nodes however -- often referred to as wallets -- simply broadcast transactions to miners. 

Nodes that validate and settle transactions are often referred to as either "miners" or "full nodes". Nodes that are simply capable of spending funds are often are referred to as "wallets", "lightweight nodes", "lightweight wallets", "SPV nodes", or "SPV clients".
