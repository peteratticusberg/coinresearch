A dapp is an application that relies on an open P2P network to store and record its data. Dapp is a portmanteau of the words "decentralized" and "application". Dapps can be thought of in contrast to any type of application that stores its data on centralized servers, like facebook, gmail, or amazon. Some of the most well known dapps that existed prior to the advent of cryptocurrency are BitTorrent and Tor. 

In the context of cryptocurrency specifically, dapps are often built on top of existing P2P networks with dapp support like Ethereum. Such dapps use the computing and storage resources of the host network (e.g. ethereum) to create and store data. They pay the host network "gas" (a coin or token, e.g. ether) whenever they need to update their data.

Etheremon is a recent example of a dapp. It runs on ethereum and allows users to buy, sell, train and battle digital monsters. It relies on the ethereum network to store data tracking who owns what, what battles have occurred, and the experience level of each monster. When end users take action that changes the data associated with the etheremon dapp, they pay a small fee (i.e. gas) in ether to the Ethereum network.
