## Pete Notes

The team looks small, about 5 or 6 people, no bios are listed for anyone on their home page. Some brief digging didn't turn up any information on them online, though to be fair the whole team is chinese and so I wouldn't necessarily expect searching for the english transliterations of their names to turn much up.
