## Coin Description

Wabi uses RFID tags to ensure the authenticity of consumer products. Wabi is based out of china where counterfeit products are much more common than they are in the united states, with companies producing everything from knockoff baby food and beer to knock off electronics. The currency, WABI, is used to purchase products authenticated by wabi technology, much in the way one might use a company-specific credit card to purchase products from a given company.
