## Soundbite

Bitcoin is a digital currency that supports basic smart contracts.

## Overview

Bitcoin was the first decentralized cryptocurrency [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency). Rather than relying on a centralized authority to validate and settle transactions, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network of computers running the Bitcoin protocol [(src)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). These computers, often referred to as miners, receive newly minted Bitcoin and transaction fees in exchange for the service they provide to the network. The current Bitcoin inflation rate is ~4% per annum ([src](http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/)) and halves roughly every 4 years [(src)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). 

The Bitcoin protocol allows the paying party to place programmatically enforced restrictions on when and how the recipient can spend the Bitcoin they've received, provided they have the recipient's consent. For example, it is possible to recieve bitcoin that cannot be spent for the first 30 days after it is received, or that can only be spent with the consent of 2 out of 3 other signatories. 

## Roadmap

Currently, the Bitcoin protocol stipulates conditions that restrict the number of settled transactions per 10 minute time period to roughly 2000 (which works out to ~3 transactions per second) [(src)](https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/historical/1w-f-tsize_per_avg-01101-txs_blk_avg-01071) [(src)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/10457/what-is-the-number-of-transactions-in-a-block). Network fees per transaction also climbed as high $55 in December 2017 [(src)](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html#3m).  Members of the Bitcoin community are currently working on implementing an overlay network that would allow for increased transaction volume and lower fees. One of most popular such networks, the Lightning Network, has estimated its theoretical limit to be "millions to billions of transactions per second" [(src)](http://lightning.network/). By comparison, Visa is capable of handling ~24k transactions per second [(src)](https://www.google.com/search?q=visa+transactions+per+second&oq=visa+trans&aqs=chrome.0.0l2j69i57j0l3.3149j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

## Team

The Bitcoin protocol was originally developed by a person or persons working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). It is currently maintained by an open group of collaborators, much in the same way that most programming languages (e.g. python, javascript, c) and the standards powering the World Wide Web are maintained (e.g. http, ssl, tcp/ip). 

## Technology

Bitcoin is (generally speaking) associated with a public key. To spend Bitcoin, you must be in posession of the private key that matches the public key associated with the funds. Private keys cannot be reverse engineered from public keys with contemporary computers, though private keys can be stolen if not stored with adequate care.

Bitcoin miners are responsible for enforcing the Bitcoin protocol. In order to participate in the mining process a node must demonstrate proof of having expended processing power (i.e. proof of work) by generating hashes. A node's control over the mining process is commensurate with the hashes it generates per second. Any actor attempting to sabotage the network would have to be capable of generating an amount of hashes approaching the number generated by honest nodes. In February 2018, the Bitcoin network was capable of generating ~10^19 hashes per second [(src)](https://blockchain.info/charts/hash-rate). By way of comparison, a $2,750 computer designed for bitcoin mining is capable of generating ~10^13 hashes per second [(src)](https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/bitmain/antminer-s9-miner/). Roughly 1 million such computers would provide hashing power equal to that of the network in February 2018.
