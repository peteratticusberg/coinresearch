## Soundbite

Ether is used to power Ethereum. Ethereum is a platform for building decentralized applications and smart contracts.

## Overview

Ethereum is a peer-to-peer protocol that runs across a network of computers. Software developers are capable of writing and executing arbitary code on that network, provided they pay the network Ether to run it. 

Ethereum can be used to develop complex contracts based on real world data that self-execute. These self executing contracts can transfer Ether from one party to another, as well as any other digital asset that exists on the ethereum platform.

Ethereum can also be used to mint, distribute, transfer, and track digital assets. Most commonly, this feature is used to create ERC20 tokens, a digital asset that behaves much like a cryptocurrency. As of February 2017, the 3 most valuable ERC20 tokens were Eos, Tron, and VeChain which had market caps of 6.2, 2.6, and 2.3 billion USD respectively [(src)](https://coinmarketcap.com/tokens/).

Other digital assets created on the Ethereum network include CryptoKitties [(src)](https://medium.com/@agalea91/crypto-kitties-by-the-numbers-6d3bbd791aac) and Etheremon [(src)](https://www.etheremon.com/#/).
