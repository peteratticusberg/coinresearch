## Soundbite

Nano is a fee-less high speed digital currency. 

## Overview

Nano transactions are feeless and settle within seconds [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf). The Nano network also claims to be capable of handling up to 7,000 transactions per second [(src)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7lw5nu/can_anyone_explain_the_7k_transactions_per_second/).

Nano's high speed and transaction volume can be primarily attributed to the way the network records transactions. Rather than using a single blockchain (viz. database), the nano network uses a set of interlinked, account-specific blockchains that together form a block lattice. This block lattice structure allows the network to record many transactions simultaneously [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf). 

Nodes in the nano network can participate the transaction settlement process to a degree commensurate with the amount of Nano they control. This also speeds up Nano relative to cryptocurrencies that require nodes to perform time-intensive computations to participate in transaction settlement. 

Nano transactions are also feeless. Nano anticipates that the more Nano an individual holds, the more likely they are to operate a node securing the network by way of protecting their investment. The protocol is designed so that even if nano were to operate at the scale of large payment processor like Visa, nodes could be run on retail hardware (e.g. a laptop). Nodes can currently be run on such hardware.  

## Roadmap

The Nano team is currently working on further reducing the amount of computing resources needed to run a raiblocks node in anticipation of future growth, and also on building out integrations with additional exchanges [(src)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/78sij4/raiblocks_road_map_2017_v20/).

## Team

Nano (originally Raiblocks) was developed by Colin LeMahieu [(src)](https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks/graphs/contributors). As of February 2017, the team consisted of 4 additional developers and 5 community managers [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/page/faq). The project was started in April 2014 [(src)](https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks/graphs/contributors?from=2014-04-25&to=2014-09-23&type=c). 

## Technology

The nano protocol is founded on design decisions that prioritize transaction speed and throughput above all else. Such decisions include using UDP instead of TCP/IP for transaction broadcasts, limiting transaction size to prevent udp packet fragmentation, and defining transaction settlement in a way that doesn't require the full network to be in sync. As consequence of these decisions, Nano is vulnerable to certain kinds of denial-of-service and double-spend attacks that other, more bitcoin-like cryptocurrencies are not. The Nano white paper enumerates several different attack vectors and discusses current and future mitigation and prevention techniques [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf).
