## Soundbite

Nano is a high speed and fee-less digital currency. 

## Overview

Nano transactions are feeless and settle within seconds [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf). The Nano network is also capable of handling up to 7,000 transactions per second [(src)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/7lw5nu/can_anyone_explain_the_7k_transactions_per_second/).

Nano's high speed and transaction volume can be primarily attributed to the way the network records transactions. Rather than using a single blockchain (viz. database), the nano network uses one blockchain per nano account. These individual blockchains are linked together via transactions forming a block lattice. This block lattice structure allows the network to record many transactions simultaneously [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf). Nano also increases transaction speed by attributing voting power to nodes commensurate with the amount of Nano they control (proof of stake) [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf) rather than requiring nodes to perform time-intensive computations in order vote (proof of work) as is often the case with cryptocurrencies.

Nano transactions are also feeless. Nano anticipates that the more Nano an individual holds, the more likely they are to operate a node securing the network by way of protecting their investment. Nano nodes can be run on consumer hardware, such as a laptop. 

## Roadmap

The Nano team is currently working on further reducing the amount of computing resources needed to run a raiblocks node in anticipation of future growth, and also on building out integrations with additional exchanges [(src)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RaiBlocks/comments/78sij4/raiblocks_road_map_2017_v20/).

## Team

Nano (originally called Raiblocks) was developed by Colin LeMahieu [(src)](https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks/graphs/contributors). As of February 2017, the team consisted of 4 additional developers and 5 community managers [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/page/faq). The project was started in April 2014 [(src)](https://github.com/clemahieu/raiblocks/graphs/contributors?from=2014-04-25&to=2014-09-23&type=c). 

## Technology

The nano protocol is founded on design decisions that prioritize transaction speed and throughput above all else. Such decisions include using UDP instead of TCP/IP for transaction broadcasts, limiting transaction size to prevent udp packet fragmentation, and defining transaction settlement in a way that doesn't require the full network to be in sync. As consequence of these decisions, Nano is vulnerable to certain kinds of denial-of-service and double-spend attacks that are unique to it. The Nano white paper enumerates several different attack vectors and discusses current and future mitigation and prevention techniques [(src)](https://raiblocks.net/media/RaiBlocks_Whitepaper__English.pdf).
