Bitcoin Cash

## Soundbite

Bitcoin Cash is a version of Bitcoin with greater transaction capacity. 

## Distinguishing Features

Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of Bitcoin. Generally speaking, there are two differences between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. 

The first is that Bitcoin Cash is capable of processing ~27 transactions/second whereas Bitcoin is only capable of processing ~3.33 transactions/second [(src)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/71346/whats-the-difference-between-btc-and-bch-transaction-capacity/71347#71347). By comparison, Visa can process ~24,000 transactions/second [(src)](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html).

The second is that, roughly speaking, mining Bitcoin Cash will eventually require ~8x the disk space and memory it takes to mine Bitcoin.

## Distinguishing Technical Features

Blocks in the Bitcoin Cash blockchain have an 8MB size limit [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Cash#Launch), where as blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain have a 1MB size limit [(src)](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_size_limit_controversy). Because one block is mined every 10 minutes, and blocks are essentially a collection of transactions, this block size limit increase is what enables Bitcoin Cash to process more transactions than Bitcoin.

## Known Limitations

Bitcoin Cash is only capable of processing ~27 transactions per second [(src)](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/71346/whats-the-difference-between-btc-and-bch-transaction-capacity/71347#71347). By comparison, Visa is capable of processing 24,000 transactions per second [(src)](https://usa.visa.com/run-your-business/small-business-tools/retail.html).

Additionally, due to the increase in block size limit, Bitcoin Cash faces long term memory and storage scalability challenges. The Bitcoin Cash blockchain can grow by up to 416GB per year. By comparison the Bitcoin blockchain can grow by up to 52GB per year.

## Technical Contributors

Like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash is maintained by an open group of collaborators. While discussions around the development of Bitcoin tend to happen in a specific set of organized and centralized forums, discussions on the development of Bitcoin Cash happen in a less organized and more decentralized manner across a wider variety of forums and groups [(src)](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7o9s4u/where_does_bitcoin_cash_development_discussion/) [(src)](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/6rj5eb/where_is_bitcoin_cash_github/). 

## Usership

There are dozens of websites that currently accept payments in Bitcoin Cash [(src)](https://acceptbitcoin.cash/). Bitcoin Cash is also widely traded, with upwards of $500M worth of BCH changing hands daily [(src)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/).
