## Soundbite

Ripple powers RippleNet. RippleNet is a platform that enables large financial institutions to efficiently exchange currencies and commodities between each other. 

## Distinguishing Features

Ripple's technology is designed for use by large financial institutions [(src)](https://ripple.com/files/ripple_solutions_guide.pdf) and the nodes powering the Ripple network are hosted by large organizations such as Microsoft, MIT, and Bahnof [src](https://ripple.com/insights/xrp-ledger-decentralizes-expansion-55-validator-nodes/). The existing network of entities hosting Ripple nodes decides whether to enable other, new entities to participate in the hosting of RippleNet [(src)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ripple/comments/4eo1le/can_i_become_a_node_in_the_ripple_network_as_an/).

RippleNet facilitates the transfer of fiat, cryptocurrency, and commodities between Ripple Gateways [(src)](https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/). A Ripple Gateway is typically a large financial instutition such as a bank, exchange, or commodities broker. Two Ripple Gateways that trust each other can use Ripple to update a shared ledger used to keep track of the amount of, e.g., USD, EUR, gold, and XRP they owe to each other [(src)](https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/#trust-lines-and-issuances). If two Gateways wish to transact that either do not trust each other or cannot transact directly for regulatory purposes they can transact through an intermediate Gateway that they both trust. If there is no single intermediate Gateway they both trust, they can transact through a chain of Gateways. In such a case, the value transfer associated with the transaction "ripples" through the Gateways until it ends up at its final destintation, hence the name of the platform. 

Note that Ripple is particularly well suited to facilitate the exchange of one asset for another, e.g. USD for EUR, gold bullion for XRP, or BTC for JPY. Also note that for all such exchanges, all RippleNet does is update a balance sheet shared between two large financial institutions which describes how much of a given asset each owes the other. It is up to the financial insitutions to actually pay each other what they are owed [(src)](https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/#trust-lines-and-issuances) in USD, BTC, gold bullion, etc. XRP is the one exception to this. RippleNet can transfer XRP instantly.

Ripple's value proposition is that, compared to contemporary systems used by large banks to transfer money, Ripple is more efficient [(src)](https://ripple.com/files/ripple_solutions_guide.pdf). Ripple estimates that it can save banks ~50% on the payment processing fees they incur, saving banks anywhere from 100s of thousands to 100s of millions of dollars per year depending on their size [(src)](https://ripple.com/cost-model/). 

The actual currency, XRP, is used by RippleNet in two ways. The first is to deter transaction spam. In order to create a transaction on RippleNet, users must destroy a small amount of XRP [(src)](https://ripple.com/build/transaction-cost/). During periods of high congestion, this amount increases [(src)](https://ripple.com/build/transaction-cost/). The second is as a bridge currency. For example, a Ripple transaction swapping USD for EUR might actually convert USD to XRP and XRP to EUR for liquidity purposes [(src)](https://ripple.com/insights/fundamentals-of-xrp/).

## Known Limitations

To the extent Ripple is used to exchange different assets (e.g. gold for euros), it relies on parties settling transaction outside of RippleNet [(src)](https://ripple.com/build/gateway-guide/#trust-lines-and-issuances). This makes this application of Ripple difficult to apply outside a network of trusted and sophisticated actors (viz. outside of the banking world).

Because admission into the network that secures and powers Ripple is gated by the large organizations that currently run Ripple nodes, Ripple also faces resistance from actors within the cryptocurrency world who favor more open and more decentralized models.

## Technical Contributors

The technology behind Ripple is developed and maintained by Ripple, a venture backed startup with over 200 employees [(src)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ripple-labs/). Ripple is open source [(src)](https://github.com/ripple/rippled). 

## Usership
