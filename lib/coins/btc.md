## Soundbite

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that supports basic smart contracts.

## Distinguishing Features

Bitcoin was the first modern cryptocurrency and has served conceptually as a starting point for subsequent coins. Because of this, virtually all features of bitcoin can be found in other cryptocurrencies. 

Bitcoin distinguished itself relative to older, less successful versions of digital currency through its decentralized structure [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency). Rather than relying a trusted central server, Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network of computers running the Bitcoin protocol to validate and settle transactions [(src)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). These computers are compensated for the service they provide to the network with newly minted bitcoin and transactions fees. The current Bitcoin inflation rate is ~4% per annum ([src](http://www.bitcoinblockhalf.com/)) and halves roughly every 4 years [(src)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). 

Though not a feature of the bitcoin protocol itself, as of Februrary 2018 the network of computers powering bitcoin is significantly larger and more computationally powerful than the network backing any other coin [(src)](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/hashrate-btc-eth-xrp-bch-ltc.html).

## Known Limitations

The Bitcoin protocol currently stipulates conditions that limit the number of transactions that can occur within a 10 minute period to roughly 2,000. This works out to approximately 3 transactions per second. By comparison, Visa is capable of processing 24,000 transactions/second. This limtation led to transaction fees as high as $55 per transaction in December 2017 [(src)](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/bitcoin-transactionfees.html). 

While it is possible to update the protocol in ways that could raise this limit, there are currently no widely supported proposals [(src)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) that would increase transaction volume by a full order of magnitude or more. There are, however, projects underway to create an overlay network on top of bitcoin [(src)](http://lightning.network/) which would be capable of facilitating 10s to 100s of thousands of bitcoin transactions per second. At a high level, such an overlay network would work by combining smaller transactions into large ones.

## Technical Contributors

The Bitcoin protocol was originally developed by a person or persons working under the name Satoshi Nakamoto [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin). It is currently maintained by an open group of collaborators, much in the same way that most programming languages (e.g. python, javascript, c) and the standards powering the World Wide Web are maintained (e.g. http, ssl, tcp/ip) [(src)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/graphs/contributors) [(src)](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors). 

## Usership

Bitcoin is accepted by thousands of businesses across the globe [(src)](https://bitcoin.org/en/spend-bitcoin). The most popular Bitcoin exchange alone, Coinbase, has 10M+ users [(src)](https://www.coinbase.com/about?locale=en-US). Cash settled Bitcoin futures are also available for trading on the CME and the CBOE [(src)](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-bitcoin-futures-contracts/bitcoin-futures-contracts-at-cme-and-cboe-idUSKBN1E92K9).
