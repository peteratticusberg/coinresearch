## Coin Name

Basic Attention Token

## Soundbite

The BAT platform uses BAT to transfer value between advertisers, content publishers, and content consumers.

## Distinguishing Features

BAT pays web users BAT for viewing digital advertisements [(src)](https://www.brave.com/about-ad-replacement/). 

In order to make this possible, it requires web users to use a BAT-enabled web browser [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf). Brave, a BAT-enabled web browser created by the team behind BAT, comes with adblocking and privacy safegaurds enabled by default [(src)](https://brave.com/). While as of February 2018 it displays no ads whatsoever [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-roadmap-1-0/), it will eventually display unobtrusive, rate-limited, opt-in, BAT-sanctioned advertisements [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf). In addition to paying the websites displaying these ads (in BAT), BAT will also pay the user (again in BAT) for viewing said advertisements [(src)](https://www.brave.com/about-ad-replacement/). The platform currently allows users to make voluntary BAT-based micropayments to content publishers using BAT that they've purchased with another currency [(src)](https://brave.com/faq-payments/#what-is-brave-payments).

The BAT platform will mete out BAT payments to web users and content publishers based on BAM (Basic Attention Metrics), which as of today stipulate that a user must be on a website for at least 25 seconds before any such payments are made. The longer a user stays on a site, the more BAT will be distributed to the site owner as well as to the user (up to a limit of ~10 minutes) [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf). Existing digital advertising platforms typically use ad clicks and impressions (i.e. views) to calculate payments. 

Additionally, BAT aims to provide strong anonymity guarantees such that there is no easily derivable connection between a given user's identity in the real world and the advertisements/content they are consuming [(src)](https://www.brave.com/about-ad-replacement/). Generally speaking, this is not the case with existing digital advertising platforms.

The BAT platform will also eventually expose sophisticated tools to advertisers content publishers that enable these groups to purchase ads and analyze advertising revenue, respectively [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf).

## Known Limitations

BAT is built on top of Ethereum. While it's possible that the BAT team could migrate BAT off of Ethereum, as of right now the scalability of BAT is at least in part dependent on the scalability of Ethereum. Ethereum is capable of supporting ~15 transactions/second [(src)](https://www.coindesk.com/information/will-ethereum-scale/). By comparison, Google search, one of the largest digital advertising platforms in the world, serves ~40K searches w/ ads per second [(src)](http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/). Ethereum is currently working on several scaling solutions that together could increase its transaction capacity by several orders of magnitude [(src)](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/scaling-ethereum-to-billions-of-users-f37d9f487db1). Additionally, there are a number of strategies BAT could employ to limit how frequently it generates Ethereum transactions.

Additionally, the success of the BAT platform in the digital advertising market will be proportional to its ability to attract three groups of users to the platform: advertisters, content publishers, and content consumers. 

Content consumers are simply people who browse the internet and land on sites with advertisements (roughly speaking, people with an internet connection). In order to get these users on the BAT platform, BAT will need to drive adoption of Brave, its BAT-enabled browser. As of February 2017, Brave currently has millions of downloads on the android platform alone. By comparison, Google chrome has over 2B active users [(src)](https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/10/google-says-there-are-now-2-billion-active-chrome-installs/) and has a ~60% share of the global browser market [(src)](https://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?options=%7B%22filter%22%3A%7B%7D%2C%22dateLabel%22%3A%22Trend%22%2C%22attributes%22%3A%22share%22%2C%22group%22%3A%22browser%22%2C%22sort%22%3A%7B%22share%22%3A-1%7D%2C%22id%22%3A%22browsersDesktop%22%2C%22dateInterval%22%3A%22Monthly%22%2C%22dateStart%22%3A%222017-02%22%2C%22dateEnd%22%3A%222018-01%22%2C%22segments%22%3A%22-1000%22%7D). 

Global digital ad revenue in 2017 was $224B USD, with 33% ($74B) of that going to Google [(src)](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/24/16020330/google-digital-mobile-ad-revenue-world-leader-facebook-growth).

## Technical Contributors

The BAT platform was co-founded by Brendon Eich, the creator of javascript and co-founder of Mozilla & Firefox. There are currently ~12 engineers on the BAT team [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/about/).

## Usership

Brave, the browser released by the BAT platform, has somewhere between 1M and 5M installs on Android based systems alone [(src)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&hl=en). Similar installation numbers for Windows and Apple devices would put usership in the millions, even if only 1/3 of installs yield an active Brave user. By comparison Google's browser Chrome has billions of users [(src)](https://venturebeat.com/2015/05/28/google-chrome-now-has-over-1-billion-users/) and has ~55% browser market share. 

As of February 2018, the BAT platform has onboarded 8,000 content publishers [(src)](https://www.investinblockchain.com/basic-attention-token-grows-publisher-list/) who are currently capable of recieving micro donations in BAT and who will eventually receive ad revenues once the platform supports that functionality.
