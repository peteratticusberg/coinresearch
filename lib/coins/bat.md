## Coin Name

Basic Attention Token

## Soundbite

The BAT platform uses BAT to transfer value between advertisers, content publishers, and content consumers.

## Distinguishing Features

The BAT platform pays web users BAT for viewing digital advertisements [(src)](https://www.brave.com/about-ad-replacement/). 

In order to make this possible, it requires web users to use a BAT-enabled web browser [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf). Brave, a BAT-enabled web browser created by the team behind BAT, comes with adblocking and privacy safegaurds enabled by default [(src)](https://brave.com/). While as of February 2018 it displays no ads whatsoever [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/bat-roadmap-1-0/), it will eventually display unobtrusive, rate-limited, opt-in, BAT-sanctioned advertisements [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf). In addition to paying the websites displaying these ads (in BAT), the BAT platform will also pay the user (again in BAT) for viewing said advertisements [(src)](https://www.brave.com/about-ad-replacement/). The platform currently allows users to make voluntary BAT-based micropayments to content publishers using BAT that they've purchased with another currency [(src)](https://brave.com/faq-payments/#what-is-brave-payments).

The BAT platform will mete out BAT payments to web users and content publishers based on BAM (Basic Attention Metrics), which as of today stipulate that a user must be on a website for at least 25 seconds before any such payments are made. The longer a user stays on a site, the more BAT will be distributed to the site owner as well as to the user (up to a limit of ~10 minutes).

Additionally, BAT aims to provide strong anonymity guarantees such that there is no easily derivable connection between a given user's identity in the real world and the advertisements/content they are consuming [(src)](https://www.brave.com/about-ad-replacement/). Generally speaking, this is not the case with contemporary digital advertising.

The BAT platform will also eventually expose sophisticated tools to advertisers content publishers that enable these groups to purchase ads and receive advertising revenue, respectively [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/BasicAttentionTokenWhitePaper-4.pdf).

## Technical Contributors

The BAT platform was co-founded by Brendon Eich, the creator of javascript and co-founder of Mozilla & Firefox. There are currently ~12 engineers on the BAT team [(src)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/about/).

## Usership

Brave, the browser released by the BAT platform, has somewhere between 1M and 5M installs on Android based systems alone [(src)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brave.browser&hl=en). Similar installation numbers for Windows and Apple devices would put usership in the millions, even if only 1/3 of installs yield an active Brave user. By comparison Google's browser Chrome has billions of users [(src)](https://venturebeat.com/2015/05/28/google-chrome-now-has-over-1-billion-users/) and has ~55% browser market share. 

As of February 2018, the BAT platform has onboarded 8,000 content publishers [(src)](https://www.investinblockchain.com/basic-attention-token-grows-publisher-list/) who are currently capable of recieving micro donations in BAT and who will eventually receive ad revenues once the platform supports that functionality.
