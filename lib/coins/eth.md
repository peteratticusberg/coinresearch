## Coin Name

Ether

## Soundbite

Ether is used to power Ethereum. Ethereum is a platform for dapps and smart contracts.

## Distinguishing Features

Ethereum was the first dapp platform and has served conceptually as a starting point for other platforms like it. As such virtually all of its features can be found in other dapp platforms such as eos, cardano, lisk, and neo. 

As of February 2018 Ethereum distinguishes itself from similar platforms in that a) it is currently fully operational and b) it has the most dapps. There are currently over 1000 decentralized applications being actively developed on top of ethereum [(src)](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/). 

## Distinguishing Technical Features

While Ethereum is currently PoW based it is switching to a PoS model via the Casper update in 2018 [(src)](https://coincentral.com/when-will-ethereum-mining-end/). This transition has always been a part of Ethereum's roadmap.

## Known Limitations

As of February 2018 Ethereum is capable of supporting no more than roughly ~15 transactions per second [(src)](https://www.coindesk.com/information/will-ethereum-scale/) [(src)](https://etherscan.io/chart/tx). By comparison facebook is capable of serving ~525k requests per second [(src)](https://medium.com/@FEhrsam/scaling-ethereum-to-billions-of-users-f37d9f487db1). Also, the fee associated with a single ethereum transaction is can be anywhere from ~0.01 USD to ~0.50 USD depending on a) the nature of the transaction and b) traffic on the network, whereas the cost of making a request to facebook is neglible and does grow higher during periods of congestion. 

There are several projects underway to address these issues within the Ethereum community including Plasma, Sharding, and Raiden. Each of the projects are complimentary to each other and were they all successfully implemented they together would likely increase the transaction capacity of the network by several orders of magnitude. Such an increase would also have the effect of decreasing transaction fees, likely by at least one order of magnitude or more. 

## Technical Contributors

Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 [(src)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum#history). The maintenance and development of the project is currently being steered by the Ethereum Foundation, of which Vitalik is himself a founder. Hundreds of developers have contributed to Ethereum [(src)](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs) [(src)](https://github.com/ethereum/yellowpaper) [(src)](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum).

## Usership

Ethereum's usership can be thought of in three parts. There are:

People using Ether as a cryptocurrency
Developers who write dapps that run on Ethereum
People who use dapps built on Ethereum

Since Februrary 2016 it Ethereum has been the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap (after Bitcoin). Ether is widely traded as a cryptocurrency, with average 24h trading volumes in the billions (USD) [(src)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/#charts). It can also be used to purchase goods from websites such as overstock.com, among others [(src)](https://smartereum.com/accepts-ethereum-payment-2018-list-companies-accept-ethereum/).

There are currently developers actively working on ~1000 ethereum dapps [(src)](https://www.stateofthedapps.com/tab/most-viewed). Some of these dapps are cryptocurrencies unto themselves, like [(Augur)](http://www.augur.net/), [(Gnosis)](https://gnosis.pm/), and [(BAT)](https://basicattentiontoken.org/), while others, such as [(cryptokitties)](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) and [(etheremon)](https://www.etheremon.com/#/), are more limited in scope. 

As for people using dapps built on Ethereum, there are no available estimates. If the average number of users per actively developed dapp is somewhere between 10 and 1000, this would put the number of ethereum dapp users at somewhere between 10,000 and 1,000,000.
