### ORC: Open Research on Coins

The goal of the ORC project is to provide unbiased and accessible information on coins to investors. Check out [our website](https://coinresearch.peteratticusberg.com) to browse existing research.

ORC is designed to be useful for non-technical and technical readers alike. If you are a non-technical reader and at any point you find the content to assume too high a level of technical knowledge, feel free to let us know [here](https://github.com/peteratticusberg/orc/issues/new).
