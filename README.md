Research on coins. 

The following are valid markdown headers:

`## Soundbite` - a short one sentence description of a coin

`## Overview` - a longer form explanation of what the coin is meant to be used for

`## Roadmap` - a description of desired end state for the coin and where it is relative to that state

`## Team` - an overview of the people and organizations involved with the coin

`## Technology` - technical details on how the coin / platform works

`## Website` - a link to the website for the coin

`## Ticker`- the ticker sym for a coin (BTC, ETH, XRB, etc.)

`## Coin Market Cap Link` - a link to the coin's coin market cap page

`## Tags` - a comma delimited list of tags that apply to the coin

Note: A lot of the coins just have soundbites at the moment and no Overview. For an example of a coin with an overview see AMB, VEN, LEND, XBY, or WABI.
