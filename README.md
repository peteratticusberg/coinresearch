### ORC: Open Research on Coins

The goal of ORC is to provide unbiased, accessible, and useful information on coins to investors. To browse existing research, see [orc.press](https://www.orc.press/coins).

ORC is designed to be useful for technical and non-technical readers alike. If you are a non-technical reader and find that any content assumes too high a level of technical knowledge, feel free to [let us know](https://github.com/peteratticusberg/orc/issues/new). 

If you are a technical reader and you find any of the content to be inaccurate or lacking important information, we'd be grateful if you could file an issue or put a up a pull request.
