### ORC: Open Research on Coins

The goal of ORC is to provide unbiased, accurate, and useful information on coins to investors. To browse existing research, see [orc.press](https://www.orc.press/coins).

This is a new project. I'd like to gauge the community's interest in: 
  1) consuming this content 
  2) adding to and improving upon what's here

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the project feel free to open on an issue or reach out to me at atticusberg [at] gmail [dot] com.

I am not a cryptocurrency domain expert though to the best of my knowledge the information contained in this repo is accurate. Please open an issue if any
